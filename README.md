Problem statement :
Railways play a vital role in transportation, but manual railway management leads to inefficiencies such as delayed ticket bookings, errors in seat allocation, and mismanagement of train schedules. A C++-based Railway Management System aims to automate these processes, ensuring smooth and efficient operations.


Functional Requirements :
1. User Management
•	Allow registration and authentication of users (admin, staff, passengers).
•	Manage user roles and permissions (e.g., admin, station manager, ticket checker).
•	Enable password reset and profile updates for users.
2. Train Scheduling and Management
•	Add, update, and delete train schedules.
•	Manage train routes, including stations and timings.
•	Handle delays and cancellations with real-time updates.
•	Provide a dashboard for train status (on-time, delayed, canceled).
3. Ticket Reservation and Booking
•	Allow passengers to search for trains based on source, destination, and date.
•	Enable online ticket booking with seat selection.
•	Support multiple payment methods (credit/debit cards, UPI, wallets).
•	Generate e-tickets with QR codes for validation.
•	Allow ticket cancellation and refund processing.
4. Passenger Management
•	Store passenger details (name, age, contact information).
•	Manage passenger preferences (e.g., seat type, meal preferences).
•	Provide booking history and upcoming journey details for passengers.
5. Station Management
•	Add, update, and delete station details.
•	Manage platform allocation for trains.
•	Display real-time train arrival and departure information at stations.
